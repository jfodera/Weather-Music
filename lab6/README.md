Lenses of User Experience: 

   Useful: 
      Doherty Threshold-> Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.
         When building an application, ensuring it runs efficiently is very important to the user experience as the faster it runs, the more productive the user will 
         be and the more useful the application is. 

      Miller’s Law -> The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
         The application doing what it needs to do without require too much out of the user increases it's usefullness. 

      Pareto Principle -> The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
         Make the best aspects of your websites the ones that the user will actually use. 

      Von Restorff Effect -> The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
         Isolating the item you will most likely need increases the usability of the application. 

      

   Desireable: 
      Aesthetic-Usability Effect -> Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.
         The better it looks, the more people are going to want it. 

      Flow -> The mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.
         Providing neccesary feedback on things is one area that would improve desireability as it ensures good flow. The more Immersed a user is, the more desireable the application 

      Goal-Gradient Effect-> The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.
         Keeping users aware to how close they are to said goal with increase how Desireable they think the website is as it will keep them invested in the task 

      Zeigarnik Effect -> People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
         If you want as user to complete a task, include progress tracker so they want to complete. 
       

      Implementations: 
         Better user feedback within the login system 
         Progress bar as moving through item submission form

   

   Valuable: 
      Cognitive Load -> The amount of mental resources needed to understand and interact with an interface.
         Having extraneous cognitive load in which the user isn't actually understanding the content of the interface in turn decreases the value of the site, as the 
         user is going there to get something. A simple site that gets the point across is valueable to the user. 
      
      Hick’s Law -> The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
         The faster the user can complete the task they came to the application for, will increase how valueable they think the application is (in most cases)

      Law of Prägnanz -> People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.
         The simpler an application and aspects of it are made to be, the more valuable said application will be to the user. 

      Parkinson’s Law -> Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.
         Make a task take as long as the user thinks it should take, if these expectation match, the application is more valuable 

      Working Memory -> A cognitive system that temporarily holds and manipulates information needed to complete tasks.
         Placing the burden of memory on the system and not the user will make the application much more valueable to the user. 

   Accessible: 
      Fitts’s Law -> The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
         While this could be agrued for many lenses, it fits here as well. If things like touch targets are too small for some visually impaired users to see (as a high percentage of people are), it greatly hinders the accessibility of the website, greatly cutting down the population of people that can actually use it. 

      Paradox of the Active User -> Users never read manuals but start using the software immediately.
         Users are not going to waste time studying how to use your website and must keep this in mind while building it. Keep it simple enough so that anyone can navigate it (if anyone is your target audience). 

      Postel’s Law ->   Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.
         Preparing for as many inputs as possible will increase the overall accessibility of the application 


   Credible:
      Mental Model -> A compressed model based on what we think we know about a system and how it works
         If you can get the user to have a mental model of the application and what it's purpose is, as long as the application is not malicous, this will increase the 
         credibility of the application as it is showing directly that it has nothing to hide. 

      Peak-End Rule -> People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.
         first impressions and how you leave off are everything. Ensuring that the first thing a user sees provides a sense of safety/credibility will help their perception
         of the credibility of the applicaiton 

      Tesler’s Law -> Tesler’s Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.
         For certain goals, there are tasks in which you cannot abstract away without reducing the credibility of the application, must keep this in mind through development. 

   Findable: 
      Cognitive Bias -> A systematic error of thinking or rationality in judgment that influence our perception of the world and our decision-making ability. (think like the user) 
         If the designer is constantly thinking like the user when designing their site (Bias's and all), the user will have an easier time finding things. 

      Law of Common Region -> Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.
         Percieving items to click on as being in common groups allows for easier naviagtion in finding what the user actually wants to find.c

      Law of Proximity -> Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.
         Yes again, similiar objects being located nearest to eachother makes them more finable as they are placed in groups. 

      Selective Attention -> The process of focusing our attention only to a subset of the stimuli in the environment — usually those related to our goals.
         Keeping Users focus on the tasks they need to in order to complete the goal requires increasing the finability of these tasks. 

      Serial Position Effect -> Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.
         Users are going to look at the first and last of a list so place the most important items there. 


   Usable:
      Chunking -> A process by which individual pieces of an information set are broken down and then grouped together in a meaningful whole.
         Chunking of data makes it easier for users to process what they are seeing and navigate the website. 

      Jakob’s Law -> Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
         The more consistent your site is with others, the easier of a time a user will have actually using it as it is similar to what they already know. 

      Law of Similarity -> The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.
         Making things that are not the same look different is vital creating application that is useable as it decreases the chances of users being confused

      Law of Uniform Connectedness -> Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.
         Yes again, similar elements should have similar appearences as this makes the application more usable. 

      Occam’s Razor -> Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
         Make things as simple as possible while still completing the desired function, doing so will make the site easier to use.
