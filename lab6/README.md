Lab 6 Notes (UI/UX):

Lenses of User Experience: 

   Useful: 
      Doherty Threshold-> Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.
         When building an application, ensuring it runs efficiently is very important to the user experience as the faster it runs, the more productive the user will 
         be and the more useful the application is. 

   Desireable: 
      Aesthetic-Usability Effect -> Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.

      Flow -> The mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.
         Providing neccesary feedback on things is one area that would improve desireability as it ensures good flow. The more Immersed a user is, the more desireable the application 

      Goal-Gradient Effect-> The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.
         Keeping users aware to how close they are to said goal with increase how Desireable they think the website is as it will keep them invested in the task 

      Implementations: 
         Better user feedback within the login system 

   

   Valuable: 
      Cognitive Load -> The amount of mental resources needed to understand and interact with an interface.
         Having extraneous cognitive load in which the user isn't actually understanding the content of the interface in turn decreases the value of the site, as the 
         user is going there to get something. A simple site that gets the point across is valueable to the user. 
      
      Hick’s Law -> The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
         The faster the user can complete the task they came to the application for, will increase how valueable they think the application is (in most cases)


   Accessible: 
      Fitts’s Law -> The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
         While this could be agrued for many lenses, it fits here as well. If things like touch targets are too small for some visually impaired users to see (as a high percentage of people are), it greatly hinders the accessibility of the website, greatly cutting down the population of people that can actually use it. 

   Credible:

   Findable: 
      Cognitive Bias -> A systematic error of thinking or rationality in judgment that influence our perception of the world and our decision-making ability. (think like the user) 
         If the designer is constantly thinking like the user when designing their site (Bias's and all), the user will have an easier time finding things. 

   Usable:
      Chunking -> A process by which individual pieces of an information set are broken down and then grouped together in a meaningful whole.
         Chunking of data makes it easier for users to process what they are seeing and navigate the website. 

      Jakob’s Law -> Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
