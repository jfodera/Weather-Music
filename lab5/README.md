Overall Notes on book related to my server:
   No need SSRM because users cannot log in or anything like that 

   GO here if can't find anything in the book: ● The CAIQ is a standard template for CSPs to document their security and compliance controls.
   ● The CCM lists cloud security controls and maps them to multiple security and compliance
   standards. The CCM can also be used to document security responsibilities.

Possible things I can do: 
   Make registry for website; see bullets
   make a policy 
   control objs 
   add .env files for database connection 
   make cloud risk profile 
   cloud register 
   See if I voilate any compliance links 
   risk register 
   make SBOM 
   
   cpsm tool run it 
   add oauth 
   http required sign in 
   add sso auth, no password 
   implement alert for specific actions that locks the user out of the application.  
      like cooldown timer on finder 
   login system as IAM is very important, This allows for only people at RPI to Acsess the weather informatio
   MFA, on RPI weather website for rpi email 
   add documentation of security measures 
   canary and honey tokens 
   prevent Cross-site scripting, 
   mabye put time limited credentials on finder
   scan vm website and fix any errors shown 
   add encryption to user associated keys (like password on finder)
