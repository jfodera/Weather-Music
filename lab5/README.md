Link to my annotations of the book: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i_00apE6WbRuG9NAQAKIfg13fG0OMvpt/view?usp=sharing




Overall Notes on book related to my server:
   No need SSRM because users cannot log in or anything like that 

   GO here if can't find anything in the book: ● The CAIQ is a standard template for CSPs to document their security and compliance controls.
   ● The CCM lists cloud security controls and maps them to multiple security and compliance
   standards. The CCM can also be used to document security responsibilities.

Possible things I can do: 
   page 41 -> Make registry for website; see bullets
   page 45 -> make a policy

   page 122 -> login system as IAM is very important, This allows for only people at RPI to Acsess the weather informatio
   page 123 -> MFA, on RPI weather website for rpi email
