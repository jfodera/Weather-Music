Lab 2 notes: 


Summary: 


Plan: 

install mariaDB and mySQL  and phpmyadmin 

Make a database format so that the website can store the JSON objects in the database √


Make a version of the website that requires you to click a button to start, only once you click, then it fetches 
   and puts JSON obj in database
   Only use PHP fetch obj out of database and display it to front end 

Then use PHP to display the same exact version of the website as last lab from the database
They have a dropdown menu of other available (pre-inserted locations) that the user can select, 
   index.php:96 is where you can insert
   selecting a new location will overwrite the existing database entry 



Before submit checklist: 


Questions: 



Outline: 


 Regarding "putting that JSON object into a MySQL database," 
 I checked with Dr. Callahan, and he mentioned that it is up 
 to you and your fellow students to decide how you want to store 
 your data and in what format within the database

 You all installed PHPMyAdmin on your VMs during the Intro class. It was not pre-installed on the VMs—I confirmed this with him as well.


Things I learned: 

. is concatenation
//$_Server, returns the name of the path of the file path currrently executing 
Without Phpmyadin, mySQl is interacted with most commonly through the command line 
Only can insert into DB if valid JSON
int(10) -> 10 is the display width, not the storage size 
Don't forget to include API ID when inserting 
Node.js is a tool that basically allows js to connect to databases
Need Node.js for use of mysql package
Must have type='module' in script in order to import 
   and then must have mysql2 installed in project directory which you can only use with node.js installed 
   will see in directory that node_modules is installed 



Future improvements: 
Use XAMPP instead of pushing to main 
Could have made the API call in PHP, but it seemed more complicated so just did it in js
   would have had to make a js call, call a php script to fetch API data and store it, now that I think about it that may have been easier 

   in the future, should have my js file running serverside with node js
