Lab 2 notes: 


Summary: 


Plan: 

install mariaDB and mySQL  and phpmyadmin 

Make a database format so that the website can store the JSON objects in the database
Make a version of the website that requires you to click a button to start, only once you click, then it fetches 
   and puts JSON obj in database

Then use PHP to display the same exact version of the website as last lab from the database
They have a dropdown menu of other available (pre-inserted locations) that the user can select, 
   index.php:96 is where you can insert
   selecting a new location will overwrite the existing database entry 



Before submit checklist:

Outline: 


 Regarding "putting that JSON object into a MySQL database," 
 I checked with Dr. Callahan, and he mentioned that it is up 
 to you and your fellow students to decide how you want to store 
 your data and in what format within the database

 You all installed PHPMyAdmin on your VMs during the Intro class. It was not pre-installed on the VMs—I confirmed this with him as well.


Things I learned: 

. is concatenation
//$_Server, returns the name of the path of the file path currrently executing 
Without Phpmyadin, mySQl is interacted with most commonly through the command line 
Only can insert into DB if valid JSON
int(10) -> 10 is the display width, not the storage size 
Don't forget to include API ID when inserting
