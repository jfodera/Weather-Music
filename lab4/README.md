Lab 4 notes: 

https://foderj.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/ITWS-2110-F24-foderj/lab3

Summary: 



Plan: 
   Only pick a subset of the functionality to make because we only have 50 mins. 
   half a page for the limitations 
   Only Chat GPT and must explicitly say when stiching together 
   MUST HAVE NO RED FLAGS ON ZAP -> upload the report 


My Subset: Dynamically changing page based on user interactions/styling
   I plan on my subset being a page that looks very similar to my original RPI Page. I want to have an initial page that has a "click to fetch API's button". I want this button to have functionality. Once I get to the main page, I want to be able to have a dropdown bar to switch between schools, include the same schools as original (RPI, Clemson, Umiami), along with a more info button that actually changes what is displayed. 



Questions: 

Promt log: 

Promt : 
How I used it: 

Prompt 1: Write a seperate php file and CSS script to make a website page that looks like this
   *included back.png* (lab4/resources) 
How I used it: Created the files in my repo and pasted in the .php and .css. Made a resources folder for the css

Prompt 2: The styles.css is in a folder called 'resources' change entire php file accordingly
How I used it: Literally just replaced index.php with new index.php
 
Promt 3: change foden sites to fodera sites
How I used it: Literally just replaced index.php with new index.php

Promt 4: Create an initial page in which basically everything currently in index.php is hidden. All that should appear is a button that says  "click to fetch from API's!". Once that button is clicked everything that was hidden in index.php whould appear. Write a new backend javascript file (also in the resources folder), along with updating the current css and php files to complete this task. The initial page I am describing that had the button should look like the image I provided
   *included init.png* (lab4/resources) 
How I used it: Copied and pasted everything in, also created new js file in resources, matching the name given to me by chatgpt 

Promt 5: I'm going to refer to the page that shows up after you click the API's button as page 2
How I used it: -

Promt 6: On page 2, add a dropdown menu with 3 options, RPI, Clemson, Umiami
How I used it: Copied and pasted everything in, added the new css to the bottom of existing 

Promt 7: Center this dropbox at the top of the page, above the current weather and suggested spotify playlists
How I used it: Deleted old dropbox section of CSS and replaced it with new, Updated entire index.php
