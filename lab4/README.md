Lab 4 notes: 

https://foderj.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/ITWS-2110-F24-foderj/lab3

Summary: 



Plan: 
   Only pick a subset of the functionality to make because we only have 50 mins. 
   half a page for the limitations 
   Only Chat GPT and must explicitly say when stiching together 
   MUST HAVE NO RED FLAGS ON ZAP -> upload the report 


My Subset: Dynamically changing page based on user interactions/styling
   I plan on my subset being a page that looks very similar to my original RPI Page, I want to be able to have a dropdown bar to switch between schools, include the same schools as original (RPI, Clemson, Umiami), along with a more info button that actually changes what is displayed.
