Lab 4 notes: 

https://foderj.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/ITWS-2110-F24-foderj/lab3

Summary: 



Plan: 
   Only pick a subset of the functionality to make because we only have 50 mins. 
   half a page for the limitations 
   Only Chat GPT and must explicitly say when stiching together 
   MUST HAVE NO RED FLAGS ON ZAP -> upload the report 


My Subset: Dynamically changing page based on user interactions/styling
   I plan on my subset being a page that looks very similar to my original RPI Page. I want to have an initial page that has a "click to fetch API's button". I want this button to have functionality. Once I get to the main page, I want to be able to have a dropdown bar to switch between schools, include the same schools as original (RPI, Clemson, Umiami), along with a more info button that actually changes what is displayed. 



Questions: 

Promt log: 

Promt : 
How I used it: 

Prompt 1: Write a seperate php file and CSS script to make a website page that looks like this
   *included back.png* (lab4/resources) 
How I used it: Created the files in my repo and pasted in the .php and .css. Made a resources folder for the css

Prompt 2: The styles.css is in a folder called 'resources' change entire php file accordingly
How I used it: Literally just replaced index.php with new index.php
 
Promt 3: change foden sites to fodera sites
How I used it: Literally just replaced index.php with new index.php

Promt 4: Create an initial page in which basically everything currently in index.php is hidden. All that should appear is a button that says  "click to fetch from API's!". Once that button is clicked everything that was hidden in index.php whould appear. Write a new backend javascript file (also in the resources folder), along with updating the current css and php files to complete this task. The initial page I am describing that had the button should look like the image I provided
   *included init.png* (lab4/resources) 
How I used it: Copied and pasted everything in, also created new js file in resources, matching the name given to me by chatgpt

How I used it: Copied and pasted everything in, added the new css to the bottom of existing 

Promt 7: Center this dropbox at the top of the page, above the current weather and suggested spotify playlists

How I used it: Concatenaated new section to the styles.css, updated the index.php with a full copy and paste

Promt 9: Put the Pick a school button and description on a higher row than the current weather and suggested spotify playlists. Put the show more info Button on a lower row than the current weather and suggested spotify playlists. 
How I used it: Pasted in only the index.html 

Promt 11: list what the entire css file should currently be
How I used it: pasted in whole new css 

Promt 12: When I click the show more info button, for the weather section show the "feels like", 'min temp', and 'max temp'. For the spotify section, show an author for each entry along with an image of the playlist. Just make up random 'placeholder values' for these fields.

Promt 17: add links to actual image files across the web to curate the page, also this extra info should only appear when I click the show more info button. When it is clicked the button should then read show less info, when that is clicked the info should go away. It should act as a toggle. 
How I used it: New index.php and backend.js
